# Kipdayo - VRChat Bilibili Video Parser

A desktop application that parses Bilibili video links for playback in VRChat world video players.

## Download

Get the latest version from the [Releases](https://github.com/xn-sakina/kipdayo/releases) page.

If you would rather skip installing the desktop app, there is also a lightweight [Tampermonkey userscript](./tampermonkey) that mirrors only the core parsing workflow. The script may lag behind the app, offers no extra features, and is maintained on a best-effort basis, so always treat the desktop version as the source of truth.
